  additional settings. If you found error in charset conversions, please
  report a bug and upload file with broken tags somewhere.

* Authentication by personal passwords. Sources may connect with the same login
  but with different passwords that will be mapped to disting entries in appropriate
  ACL file. Login is fully ignored because some clients doesn't allow enter it.
  This is a separate method of authentication that can be enabled per-mount:

  In icecast.xml:
  <mount>
    <mount-name>dj-mount</mount-name>
    <authentication type="radio">
      <option name="filename" value="/etc/dj.acl"/>
    </authentication>
    <!-- other settings -->
  </mount>

  ACL file consists of lines that contain fields separated by TAB character (ASCII code 9) in
  following order:
    password               - md5 hash (unsalted, will be fixed later)
    unique user identifier - it will be shown on mount, we prefer to use JIDs here
    banned-till            - UNIX timestamp before which user with this password can't login
    nickname               - user nickname that will be shown on mount
    skype                  - skype that will be shown on mount
  Any line starting with '#' considered a comment.
  Example file:
#md5   uid   banned-till   nick   skype
21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3	root@localhost	0	King the Allmighty	echo123
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99	nobody@localhost	1356984000	banned-till 2013-01-01 GMT+4	echo123

  Note that any fields (including user identifier) can contain spaces, but not tabs. Fields must be separated
  exactly by one tab.
